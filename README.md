# Medik

_MediaWiki skin for WikiSkripta.eu._

The Medik skin is a simple Bootstrap-based skin originally created for [WikiSkripta](https://www.wikiskripta.eu).

## Installation

* Download and place the file(s) in a directory called Medik in your `skins/` folder.
* Add the following code at the bottom of your `LocalSettings.php`:

		wfLoadSkin( 'Medik' );

* Done - Navigate to `Special:Version` on your wiki to verify that the skin is successfully installed.

## Customization

### Global settings

#### Theme color

It is possible to set the color theme by inserting `$wgMedikColor` to your `LocalSettings.php`:

    $wgMedikColor = '#FF0000';
    
Possible values are either hex values of HTML colors, or named values as used in CSS.

    $wgMedikColor = 'blue';
    
Default value is `#ffbe00` as used in WikiSkripta project.

#### Responsive skin

Note that this skin is responsive by default, i.e. it fits the screen both on deskops and on mobile screens. If you need unresponsive design, just set in `LocalSettings.php`:

    $wgMedikResponsive = false;

#### Content width

At large screens, the main content container (with articles, texts, etc.) is 9/12 of the screen width and sidebar menu takes 2/12 of the screen width. It means that 1/12 of the screen width on the right side remains white. This is the default and looks good.

But there can be cases when you need your wiki to extend to the full width of the screen even on the large screens. Then you can use `wgMedikContentWidth` variable in your `LocalSettings.php` and set that to `full`:

    $wgMedikContentWidth = 'full';

Then the main content container will take 10/12 of the screen width (and 2/12 remain for the sidebar menu).

### User settings

Moreover, every user is able to change the default font size in his/her user settings. It's found in `Special:Preferences` under the skin preferences.

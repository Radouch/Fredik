========================

This is a MediaWiki skin based on Bootstrap library, originally
created for WikiSkripta.

All documentation for this template can be found at:

    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Medik

For installation or upgrading download and place the files in
a directory called 'Medik' in your 'skins/' folder of MediaWiki
installation. Add the following code at the bottom of your
LocalSettings.php:

    wfLoadSkin( 'Medik' );
    $wgDefaultSkin = 'medik';

However, if you install this plugin manually, make sure it is
installed in 'lib/tpl/wikipraktik' correctly.

# Skin Fredik for MediaWiki

This is a MediaWiki skin based on the Bootstrap library, intended for the website <https://www.franklinova-expedice.cz>, originally
created for [WikiSkripta](https://www.wikiskripta.eu) as **[Medik](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Medik)**.

The main difference from the original Medik is the use of a custom SCSS file for styling, allowing you to customize Bootstrap variables. There are also changes to the footer layout and to the styling of the sidebar and search box.

The skin should be compatible with _MediaWiki 1.43_ and is likely compatible with _MediaWiki 1.44_ (not tested).

> **WARNING**
> This skin is rather a one‑off: there is no promise to develop it further (e.g., to keep it compatible with future MediaWiki releases).
> That said, all comments, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome.
> I strongly recommend trying the original Medik skin as well.

## Download

Download the whole repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your machine or clone it using Git.

## Customization

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your machine.
2. Go to the folder where you extracted the skin files and install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Open the `resources/scss/_variables-custom.scss` file and customize the Bootstrap variables as needed. For more information about customizing Bootstrap, see <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/overview/>.
4. Build the custom CSS by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run build:bootstrap:min
   ```

- There is no way to customize the Bootstrap JavaScript file within this skin.
- If you can’t or don’t want to customize Bootstrap styles as described above, you can use the [original CSS files provided by Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/) or provide your own compiled Bootstrap CSS. Place the file `bootstrap.min.css` in `resources/libraries/` in the skin folder.

## Installation in MediaWiki

1. Create a folder `Fredik` in the `skins/` directory of your MediaWiki installation.
2. Upload the contents of the skin folder from your machine, **excluding `node_modules/`** (it won’t be used on the server).
3. Add the following code at the bottom of your `LocalSettings.php`:

   ```php
   wfLoadSkin( 'Fredik' );
   // If you want to use it as default skin
   $wgDefaultSkin = 'fredik';
   ```

4. You can use all configuration parameters described on the **original Medik skin** page on MediaWiki:
<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Medik>
but replace the `M` prefix with `Fr`, e.g. `$wgFredikColor` instead of `$wgMedikColor`.

There is one additional parameter specific to _Fredik_ — `$wgFredikSubtitle`. This is an optional subtitle shown after the site title on desktop.
